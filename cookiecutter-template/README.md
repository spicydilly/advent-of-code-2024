> This uses [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for generating the template

This template will generate the following:

- `solutions/dayXX.py` for the day's solution.
- `tests/test_dayXX.py` for unit tests.
- `inputs/dayXX-example.txt` for example input.

## How to Use

Run the following command from the root of the repository:

```

The files will then be placed in the appropriate locaions.
